The Phoenician alphabet was the first to use a distinct symbol for each distinct sound, which made it a significant innovation in writing systems.\n\n     The Greeks adopted and adapted the Phoenician alphabet to create their own around 750 BCE. They added vowel sounds and modified some of the consonant symbols to create the Greek alphabet, which consists of 24 characters. The Greek alphabet was the first to include vowel sounds, making it a more comprehensive and expressive writing system.\n\n     The Greek alphabet has had a significant impact on the development of many other alphabets, including the Latin alphabet used in English and many other languages.", "reasoning_chains": []}
